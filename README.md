# Words2Code
An application that converts handwritten text into runnable Python code, using a Machine learning model to convert handwritten text to machine text and then into python.

## Code-tab

After the conversion is done the result will be shown in a code editor style tab, the user can write code or edit converted code. The user can then run the  script and the result will be shown in the terminal below.

## Pseudo-Code tab

As seen in the picture this tab allows the user to scrible and later convert it. The user can also upload a picture of a handwritten pseudo code picture that will be converted.

## Example:

If we we upload the following image:

<img src="https://github.com/ItayHasidi/Words2Code/blob/main/Words2Code/resources/in/example.jpg" width=30% height=30%>

We will get this output:

<img src="https://github.com/ItayHasidi/Words2Code/blob/main/Words2Code/images/Example-Screenshot.png" width=50% height=50%>

You can see that the program hase successfully converted the image to a Python file ('x++' does no exist in Python, instead the program has put: 'x +=1').  

Explenation:
1. Tab menu.
2. Code editor.
3. Run the .py file.
4. Upload an image.
5. Clears the code editor.
6. Program's result is shown here.
